### Hardware Selection

Buy what you can afford, or use what you already have. An old laptop lying around? Using an old laptop or any spare hardware can be a cost-effective way to dive into homelab projects. Below are some options if you do decide to buy some hardware.
Personally, I went the Mini PCs route since I felt they were the best bang for your buck and I wanted a fleet of them (3 or more).

<CardGrid>
    <LinkCard title="Mini PC" href="/resources/mini_pc/" />
    <LinkCard title="Raspberry Pi" href="/resources/raspberry_pi/" />
    <LinkCard title="Server" href="/resources/server/" />
</CardGrid>
