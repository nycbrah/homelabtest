title: What is a Homelab?
description: Explain what a Homelab is.
---

If you're here, you likely have an idea, but let's clarify: a Homelab is your personal hardware setup at home. This setup often includes servers, networking gear, storage devices, and virtualization platforms.

## Reasons to build

Here are some of the reasons to build a Homelab:

- Learning IT and networking skills that can get you the skills needed for a job. Jobs such as a system administrator, a devops engineer, a site reliability engineer, and so forth.
- Learning IT and networking skills for fun
- Tinkering around with self-hosted applications outside a work environment to build out quick POCs (proof of concepts)
- Advanced home automation
- Hosting a media server
- Storing your data privately instead of on the cloud

## Limitations

### Time

The amount of time you can invest in building a Homelab is probably the biggest limitation. You're going to research topics heavily, debug issues frequently, and also spend time maintaining and upgrading the Homelab as you go.

### Money

A Homelab is not cheap, here are some of the costs to consider:

1. **Hardware** (servers, networking equipment, storage devices, etc.): This includes the initial investment in physical equipment like servers, switches, routers, and any other hardware components needed for your Homelab setup. This will be your biggest expense, be cautionary and buy what you can afford.
2. **Domain registration**: if you want to access your homelab using a custom domain name (e.g., myhomelab.com) instead of IP addresses, you'll need to register and renew the domain, which incurs an annual fee.
3. **Power consumption**: Running servers, networking gear, and other equipment can contribute to increased electricity usage, leading to higher electricity bills. The older servers with older gen CPUs may be cheaper to buy, but also come at a higher electricity bill.
4. **Backup and disaster recovery solutions**: If you care if your data in your Homelab is lost, you'll need to implement a backup solution. There are a few outlined here. TODO: add link to backup strategies
5. **Subscriptions**:  You may need licenses or subscriptions for applications, security software, or productivity tools used within your homelab environment. For example, if you are interested in hosting a media server, one of the pathways to fetch that media is a Usenet client(TODO: link usenet clients) involves paying for subscriptions.
6. **Security tools**: If you want to enhance your security, i.e. such as adding a VPN service for your Homelab, that will incur additional costs.
### Hardware

This ties into money, but how powerful a CPU is will matter for CPU intensive tasks or running multiple tasks in parallel. The amount of RAM you have will heavily dictate how many apps you can run in your hardware. For running tasks such as larger LLMs, you may need a GPU.
